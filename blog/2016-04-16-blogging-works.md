# This is a sample blog page

The blogging template, views/blog-post.ejs, doesn't currently do anything with
the post's title or date. The title "This is a sample blog page" is part of the
page itself.

## Publishing a blog post.

Instructions will be in the README.md file of the main repository. The basic
idea is that you create a file with your content, run the Wintersmith build
command, and then commit the static files to the `public/blog/` directory.

## That's all for now

Happy blogging!
